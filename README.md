# _A Goth Day Out_

#### _Second week Code review, March 25th 2016_

#### By _**C.G. Acharjya**_

## Description

_Vacation Picker for Goths_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _All the files are included in this repository. It uses JavaScript, Bootstrap min, and a bunch of other things._



## Known Bugs


_update: Bugs fixed in most recent version. Stil optimized for firefox, not as reactive as I'd like, but funcionality is good. "$("#retry").hide()" -this doesn't make sense for the logic of this site. I could add a reset button to hide. EXAMPLE LOGIC: aditional button reset(function(){hidescript}) Though i clearly understand how to implement it. _
